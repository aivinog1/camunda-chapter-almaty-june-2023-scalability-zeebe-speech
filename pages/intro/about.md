# What are we going to talk about?

In short - a huge amount of topics :)

- Take a short walk to the Zeebe architecture
- I'll share our experience with scalability and performance
- Deep dive into the technical aspects of Zeebe and some optimizations that you can use in the real-life scenarios
- We will focus on the JVM stack for client applications
- We will **not** touch BPMN in this speech. Too much info for your already :)
